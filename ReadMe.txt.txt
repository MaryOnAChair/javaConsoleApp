 This program uses 3 java classes: cashRegister, transactions, and PrintReceipt in order to set up an instance of a virtual register.         
 The program is based on the idea of the registers I used at my previous job, there are basic functions for setting up the tax rate       
 as well as the starting cash in the till. The program prints a receipt to a new file for every transaction, and prints the order summary in the terminal. 
 The program also prints a record of the transactions made by the logged-in employee, when no more transactions are wanted. 
 The record shows the starting and ending values of cash as well as the number of transactions. 
 I have also added features in order to prevent the user from entering garbage with the while (!sc.hasNextDouble()) loop. This checks to make sure the value type entered matches the type being assigned.

 I tried to incorporate as many concepts I have learned throughout the semester that I could ( including but not limited to) :

	- Classes & Objects
	- Functions & Loops
	- Boolean and conditional statements
	- File Creation and Printing
	- User Input and Displaying Output
	- Arrays and diff variable types
	- String formatting and rounding
 
 This project still only has basic cash register functions but its works as a virtual one.
